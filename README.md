## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before running TeleScope, ensure that you have the following installed:

- Python 3.9+
- Poetry (for dependency management)
- A PostgreSQL database (if using a different database, ensure it's properly configured in `settings.py`)
- Telegram Bot API token (from [BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots#botfather))

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SulimanSagindykov/TeleScope.git
cd TeleScope
```

### 2. Setup with Poetry
First, ensure you have Poetry installed:

```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

#### Install project dependencies:

```bash
poetry install
```

### 3. Setup Environment Variables
Create a .env file at the root of the project and add the necessary environment variables. You can also use export in your terminal.

Example .env file:

```bash
TOKEN_BOT=your_telegram_bot_token
ADMIN_ID=your_admin_chat_id
DB_NAME=your_database_name
DB_USER=your_database_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
```
### 4. Apply Database Migrations
Before starting the bot, ensure the database is set up correctly.

```bash
poetry run python manage.py migrate
```

### 5. Run the Bot
To start the bot:

```bash
poetry run python manage.py run_bot
```

### Running the Django Server
You can also run the Django server for the web interface (if needed):

```bash
poetry run python manage.py runserver
```

### Usage
Once the bot is running, you can manage subscribers and invite links for your Telegram channels or groups. The bot handles:

 - Notifications when a user joins or leaves a channel.
 - Monitoring invite links to check which ones were used to join.
 - Sending detailed user data (username, ID, join method) to the admin.
###  Bot Commands
- ```/start```: Start the bot and receive a welcome message.
- ```/help```: Get help with the bot's functionality.
- The bot sends real-time updates to the admin based on user activity in the monitored channels.


### Database Migrations
If you make changes to the models or database schema, you will need to create and apply migrations:

```bash
poetry run python manage.py makemigrations
poetry run python manage.py migrate
```
### Running the Tests
To run the tests and ensure everything is functioning correctly:

```bash
poetry run python manage.py test
```
